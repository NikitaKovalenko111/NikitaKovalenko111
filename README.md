# Who am I?

Hi, my name is Nikita, I'm from Russia and I am a fullstack web developer. I've been coding for about six years. I started from C++, then learnt C# and now I'm a web developer. Sometimes I dropped coding for months on my way but now I'm here.

My projects you can see in the repositories so I won't mention them here. Every project has a detailed README file so you can read it.

# What technologies do I know?

I'm still learning but I know a big stack of technologies now, such as:

### Frontend

![CSS](./img/css-logo.png)

![JS](./img/js-logo.png)
![Typescript](./img/typescript-logo.png)
![React](./img/react-logo.png)
![Redux](./img/redux-logo.png)

### Backend

![Node](./img/node-logo.png)

<img src="./img/nest-logo.png" alt="NestJS" width="32px" />
<img src="./img/mongodb-logo.png" alt="MongoDB" width="14px" />

And less important such as **axios**, **formik**, **react-router-dom**, **redux-thunk**, **redux-saga** in **frontend** and **bcrypt**, **jsonwebtoken** in backend...
